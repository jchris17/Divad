        <h3>An Intro to BIT Club</h3>
        <p class="second">
        The BIT club was created to encourage and help with learning about BIT. We were founded in 2015 and have
        made it our mission to help people ever since. Our club died a little bit, but were able to revamp ourselves
        just last year under the leadership of Anna Lee
